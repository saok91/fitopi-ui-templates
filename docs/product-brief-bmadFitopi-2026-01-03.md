# Product Brief: bmadFitopi

## Executive Summary

bmadFitopi is a coaching-first product designed to help people with overweight (Phase 1) achieve sustainable weight loss and maintain it, and ultimately (final phase) build healthier lifestyles long-term.

We believe the main reason people fail is not lack of information, but lack of consistent coaching: support, accountability, and adaptive guidance over time. Many users start strong, but quit mid-way due to stress, fatigue, social pressure (e.g., parties), sleep deprivation and daily routine disruption, or hormonal changes. Repeated failed attempts make restarting even harder.

Unlike calorie counters, static meal plan apps, and one-off diet courses, bmadFitopi creates an interactive feedback loop: it continuously learns the user’s context through simple daily check-ins plus calorie and weekly weight data, detects risk of quitting, and revises guidance and plans accordingly.

The core coach is AI-first, with the option of human involvement in early phases if needed. Our promise in Phase 1 is straightforward: help users keep going, achieve weight loss, and maintain results.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

People who want to lose weight often start with good intentions, but fail to sustain progress because they lack a personalized, interactive coach that provides ongoing support, accountability, and adaptive guidance when real life gets in the way.

### Problem Impact

When weight loss efforts stall or stop, users remain overweight and experience negative consequences across health and self-confidence. Over time, repeated failures reduce belief in achieving lasting change and make it harder to start again.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Current options like nutritionists, calorie trackers, meal plan apps, and diet courses often:

- Provide static guidance that is not continuously interactive or adaptive
- Lack strong accountability and support mechanisms when motivation drops
- Do not systematically capture user feedback and revise plans based on real adherence patterns
- Fail to anticipate and actively manage “break points” (stress, fatigue, social events, sleep disruption, hormonal shifts) where users are most likely to quit

### Proposed Solution

bmadFitopi delivers an interactive coaching experience that builds a deep understanding of each user and proactively supports them through high-risk moments. It collects ongoing feedback (daily check-ins, calorie intake/burn, weekly weight), detects obstacles and likely failure points, and adjusts recommendations and the user’s plan over time.

In Phase 1, the product is B2C and focused on users who have tried before but tend to quit mid-way; the coaching is AI-first, with potential human support in early phases if needed.

### Key Differentiators

- Coaching-first approach focused on sustainable outcomes (loss + maintenance), not just tracking
- A continuous feedback loop that revises the user’s path based on real behavior and signals
- A “recovery loop” mindset: slips are expected; the plan adapts to help users return to the path
- Lightweight onboarding (start fast, personalize over time)

**Tagline (Phase 1):** Sustainable weight loss, with an interactive coach.

## Target Users

### Primary Users

**Primary segment:** Women aged 25–35 with BMI between 25–30.

**Persona: Zahra (The Yo-Yo Striver)**

- **Profile:** 29 years old, HR employee, ~15kg overweight (BMI 25–30).
- **History:** ~10 years struggling with weight. 5+ attempts; often sees early progress but either doesn’t reach her target or regains weight later.
- **Core struggle:** Not lack of information—it's sustaining change under real-life pressure, especially **stress/high emotions** and likely **hormonal factors**.
- **Success definition:** Sustainable weight loss plus maintenance, with a tangible improvement in day-to-day quality of life.

### Secondary Users

**Support circle (indirect):** Partner first, then friends and colleagues.

- Not direct users of the product, but they can be influenced by the user’s new knowledge, habits, constraints, and confidence.
- They can act as accidental supporters or accidental saboteurs (e.g., social pressure around food), even when the product is strictly B2C.

### User Journey

**Discovery**

- Zahra discovers bmadFitopi through messaging focused on breaking the “start/quit/regain” cycle and handling stress-driven slip-ups.

**Onboarding (Low Friction + First Day Victory)**

- Fast onboarding (minutes) to reduce drop-off for users who already feel tired of “starting again.”
- The product aims to create a **micro-aha** immediately: the coach understands her and responds with empathy.
- Ends with a guaranteed **first-day win** (a small, doable commitment) to rebuild confidence.

**Core Usage (Interactive Coaching Loop)**

- Daily check-ins (context + adherence) + calorie intake/burn + weekly weight.
- The coach learns personal patterns (e.g., stress days, high-risk moments, likely non-adherence points).
- Guidance is revised based on real behavior and feedback, not a fixed plan.

**Aha Moments (Emotional + Insight)**

- **Emotional aha:** On a stressful day, Zahra slips. Instead of shame or punishment, the coach empathizes and offers a realistic recovery step.
- **Insight aha:** The coach surfaces patterns Zahra didn’t fully connect before (e.g., stress/emotion/hormone-linked cravings) and proposes a tailored adjustment.

**Long-term**

- Weight loss becomes sustainable and maintainable.
- Zahra feels supported through inevitable life disruptions rather than feeling “I failed again.”

## Success Metrics

### User Success Metrics

**Program completion (8-week goal achievement)**

- Users select one of three 8-week tracks during onboarding:
	- Easy: **3%** body weight reduction in 8 weeks
	- Medium: **5%** body weight reduction in 8 weeks
	- Challenging: **7%** body weight reduction in 8 weeks
- Success metric: **% of users who achieve their selected track target by week 8**

**Maintenance (result durability)**

- Definition of “maintained results”: weight remains within **±1–2% of body weight**
- Suggested measures:
	- **% of users within ±1–2% at 4 weeks after week-8 completion**
	- **% of users within ±1–2% at 8 weeks after week-8 completion**

**Engagement behaviors (leading indicators of success)**

- **Calorie logging adherence**: consistency of calorie intake/burn logging
- **Coach interaction adherence**: responding to coach messages + completing daily check-ins
- **Regular weigh-ins**: consistent weight logging cadence

Suggested measurable definitions (targets TBD):

- % of users logging calories on ≥5 days/week (Weeks 1–8)
- % of users completing daily check-ins on ≥5 days/week (Weeks 1–8)
- % of users logging weight at least weekly (Weeks 1–8)

### Business Objectives

**3-month objectives**

- Total signups: **1,000**
- Paid users: **60** (implied overall paid conversion ≈ **6%**)

**12-month objectives**

- Total signups: **10,000**
- Paid users: **413** (implied overall paid conversion ≈ **4.13%**)

**Monetization model**

- **1-week free trial** with full access
- After trial: subscription to retain coaching; otherwise free tier with limited access (likely calorie tracker only, no coach)

### Key Performance Indicators

**Growth**

- Signups (3 months): 1,000
- Signups (12 months): 10,000

**Trial funnel**

- Trial starts (count) and trial start rate (% of signups)
- Trial completion rate (% reaching day 7)
- Trial-to-paid conversion rate:
	- 3 months: 60 paid / 1,000 signups ≈ 6%
	- 12 months: 413 paid / 10,000 signups ≈ 4.13%

**Engagement (leading indicators)**

- % weekly active users interacting with coach (messages + check-ins)
- Calorie logging consistency (e.g., ≥5 days/week)
- Weekly weigh-in adherence (% with at least 1 weigh-in/week)

**Outcome**

- % achieving selected 8-week track target (3%/5%/7%)
- Maintenance rate: % within ±1–2% weight band at 4 and 8 weeks post-program

## MVP Scope

### Core Features

1) **8-Week Program Setup (Track Selection)**

- Onboarding ends with selecting one 8-week track (3% / 5% / 7% target).
- Generates a clear goal and program structure that the user commits to.

2) **Calorie Tracking (Input + Output)**

- Calorie intake logging + calorie burned (as available/entered by user).
- Provides the base signal required for coaching and progress evaluation.

3) **Adaptive Coach Loop (Interactive + Revising)**

- Daily check-ins + two-way coach messaging (empathetic support, accountability).
- A lightweight weekly plan revision based on real user signals (calories, check-ins, weekly weight).
- Includes “recovery” behavior: after slip-ups, the coach responds without shame and offers a small next step (First Day Victory + Recovery Loop).

4) **Weekly Weight Logging (Minimum)**

- Weekly weigh-ins are part of the core loop (required signal).
- Simple view of recent entries is enough for MVP (advanced charts can wait).

5) **Photo-based Calorie Estimation (MVP Optional – Low-risk only)**

- Include in MVP only if implementation is low-risk using existing AI tooling/APIs with acceptable accuracy/cost.
- If it becomes complex (data collection, fine-tuning, heavy QA, high error risk), defer to Post‑MVP.

### Out of Scope for MVP

- Wearables / step counter / smartwatch integrations
- B2B or B2B2C distribution (clinics, nutritionists-as-admin, etc.)
- Community / groups / social features
- Sensitive hormonal tracking as a required data set (can be optional later)
- Advanced analytics dashboards and complex progress visualizations

### MVP Success Criteria

**Business gate (3 months)**

- Reach **1,000 signups**
- Achieve **≥4% paid conversion** (paid users / signups)

**Product health (leading indicators)**

- Consistent coach interaction (daily check-ins + replies)
- Regular calorie logging
- Weekly weigh-ins recorded

**User outcome**

- % of users achieving their selected 8-week goal (3%/5%/7%)
- Maintenance proxy: staying within ±1–2% weight band post-program (tracked after MVP)

### Future Vision

- Photo-based calorie estimation (if not shipped in MVP)
- Optional deeper personalization inputs (including hormonal context, with privacy-first controls)
- Integrations (steps/sleep) to improve prediction of “break points”
- More sophisticated progress insights and habit coaching toward “healthier living” beyond weight loss
